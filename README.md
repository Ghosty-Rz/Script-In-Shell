# Script in shell
 
 I run it using Ubuntu, access the directory, compile the file, then run it using ./display_question_answers

 This is a small game that shuffles 15 questions and gives 3 suggestions for each question, you get a different score for each question and get your total score at the end.
 The program creates a progress file where it saves your latest score.
